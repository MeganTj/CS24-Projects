Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?
We first set the permissions of all pages to PROT_NONE so that any attempt to
access the memory results in a segfault. When we segfault, we change the
accessed bit to 1 and set the permission of the page to PROT_READ so that
another access to this page does not result in a segfault.


b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?
We first set the permissions of all pages to PROT_READ so that any attempt to
write to the memory results in a segfault. When we segfault, we change the
dirty bit to 1 and set the permission of the page to PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE
so that the next writes to this page do not result in segfaults.


f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:
54351

g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  FIFO 

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  47944

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  Aging

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_aging -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 6738 

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.

The above page-load rate is for 8 bits of age. For 16 bits, the page-load
rate is 6765. For 32 bits, the page-load rate is 6775. As the number of
bits used to store age increases, the page-load rate increases, but by a
marginal number.
