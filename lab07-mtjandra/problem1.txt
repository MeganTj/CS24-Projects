The problem in the programs output is that only the numbers generated by
producer 0 is printed out. This occurs because when the first producer
yields, it always does so because the buffer is full. So when it yields to
the second producer, the buffer is still full, so the second producer
yields to the consumer thread without adding anything to the buffer.
