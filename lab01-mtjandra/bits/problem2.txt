Expression:  n = n & (n - 1)
----------------------------
The expression changes the rightmost 1 bit of n to a 0 bit. 

It works because for n-1, the bit at the position of the rightmost 1 bit of n is now a 0. Thus, the bitwise-and operation removes the rightmost 1 bit of n. 

It is faster as it does not require shift operations.
